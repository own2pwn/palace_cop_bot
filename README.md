# palace_cop_bot

Palace Skateboards.

Ok so basically, you input some keywords in the script, 4 of them. The keyworks must match ONLY ONE item in the end, if two items are 
left, nothing will be copped.

For now, this only scraps all the item links in the page, then it gets rid of the one not containing the keywords.

For now, it's a work in progress, it doesn't work, I have absolutly no time to make this work, but it could easily work.
